# ProLingo Accessibility Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility features implemented in the ProLingo application to ensure it's usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. The application follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines and best practices for web accessibility.

## Implemented Accessibility Features

### Navigation

- **Skip to Content**: A "Skip to Content" link is available at the beginning of each page, allowing keyboard users to bypass the navigation menu.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard, with `tabIndex` attributes ensuring proper tab order.
- **Semantic Structure**: Proper HTML5 semantic elements (`nav`, `main`, `header`, `footer`, etc.) with appropriate ARIA roles.

### ARIA Implementation

- **Landmarks**: Key page regions are marked with appropriate ARIA roles (banner, navigation, main, contentinfo).
- **Labels**: Interactive elements have descriptive labels or aria-label attributes.
- **Live Regions**: Dynamic content updates (like loading states and error messages) use `aria-live` to announce changes to screen readers.

### Forms and Interactive Elements

- **Form Accessibility**:
  - Forms have descriptive labels and instructions
  - Required fields are indicated with `aria-required="true"`
  - Error messages are announced with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"`
  - Form fields with errors use `aria-invalid="true"`

- **Buttons and Controls**:
  - Interactive elements have appropriate roles (e.g., `role="button"`)
  - Custom controls include keyboard event handlers
  - Focus states are visually indicated

### Content and Media

- **Text Alternatives**: Images have appropriate alt text
- **Decorative Elements**: Purely decorative elements use `aria-hidden="true"`
- **Color Contrast**: Text maintains sufficient contrast with background colors
- **Responsive Design**: Content is accessible at various screen sizes and zoom levels

## Testing Procedures

1. **Keyboard Testing**: Verify all functionality is available without a mouse
2. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with popular screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
3. **Automated Tools**: Use tools like Lighthouse and axe to identify common issues

## Future Improvements

- Add more descriptive aria-labels to complex components
- Implement more robust focus management for modal dialogues
- Improve error handling and announcements
- Add skip links to more sections for faster keyboard navigation
